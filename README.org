** David Flanagan
Many thanks to [[http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/about/][David Flanagan]] for his wonderful guidebook, [[http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/bouldering-in-ireland/][Bouldering in Ireland]].
The list is taken mainly from this guidebook, and some extra metadata has been added, including GPS coordinates for all areas.
This wouldn't exist without his hard work.

Converting OSI Grid References to GPS was a snap thanks to the API at http://batlab.ucd.ie/gridref/
